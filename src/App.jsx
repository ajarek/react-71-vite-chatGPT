        <p>
          As an AI language model, I don't have a physical presence or use fonts
          like humans do. However, the font used to display my responses on a
          website or interface can be set by the website or application
          developer using CSS styles. The font family used for ChatGPT's
          responses would depend on the specific implementation and design
          choices made by the developer.
